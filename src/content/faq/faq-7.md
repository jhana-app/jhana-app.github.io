question: How is your app connected to the TMI, TWIM, and Right Concentration?
---
Our app is designed to help users develop and maintain good habits on their path to achieving Jhﾄ］as. While it is not directly connected to any of these three methodologies, it draws inspiration from them and incorporates some of their principles and techniques along with many others teachings (by Rob Burbea, Michael Taft, Shaila Catherine etc).

For example, the TMI (The Mind Illuminated) methodology focuses on developing stable attention and cultivating mindfulness, which are both essential for achieving Jhﾄ］as. Our app includes guided meditations and exercises that help users develop these skills and can be mapped to the first 6 stages of TMI. If your goal is to achieve samatha, TMI would be the best resource.

Similarly, the TWIM (Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation) methodology emphasizes cultivating feelings of loving-kindness and compassion, which can also be beneficial for achieving Jhﾄ］as. Our app includes meditations that focus on these qualities and encourage users to develop a more positive and compassionate mindset. That significantly improves development of Piti and loving-kindness meditation opens one of the fastest way to access jhana.

"Right Concentration" by Leigh Brasington is one of the best resources for developing and transitioning between different Jhanas.

Overall, while our simulator is not directly connected to any of these three methodologies, it draws inspiration from them and incorporates some of their key principles in order to help users achieve Jhﾄ］as.
